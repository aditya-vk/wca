## Whatsapp Chat Analyzer

This program will perform basic analysis of a whatsapp chat. Implemented:
- Number of messages, averaged by the number of days
- Speaker frequency
- Word frequency
- Emoji frequency
- General topic classifier

### Prerequisite
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/)

I recommend to use [python xy](https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/) distribution which included all necessary libraries (and even more)

### To run
``` python wca.py <filename> ```

Example

``` python wca.py chat.txt ```
